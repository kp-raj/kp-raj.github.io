    <h3>Racey</h3>
    <p>Videogames, as fun as they are, make creating them much more interesting. To learn that, I built a simple car game avoiding the obstacles using Pygame module of Python. </p>

    <h3>Bills</h3>
    <p>People usually stop caring about the policy making once they choose their representatives. I believe that people should be aware of what policies are being discussed and what is their representative’s stand on each of those bills.</p>
    <p>My experience, as an intern at the Lok Sabha of the Parliament of India, has made me realize the epic process of policy making. I collected every bill that had been introduced in both the houses of Parliament from 1947 to 2020 and saved the information in a database.</p>
    <div class="card" style="margin:10%;"><img src="/images/pro-6/3.png"></div>
    <p>I created a web application where a user can search for any bill that has been introduced, passed, assented, negatived, pending, withdrawn with various types of filters. I deployed the app using Heroku.</p>
    <div class="card" style="margin:10%;"><img src="/images/pro-6/5.png"></div><br>
    <h5>See it <a href="https://bills-kpr.herokuapp.com/" style="text-decoration: none;">Live</a></h5>
    <p><i>Extensions planned:</i> Use the Right To Information Act (RTI) to collect the data of the votes of every representative regarding each bill. Display those votes of every representative/party to know what their stand. Showing who introduced what bill and who voted against or towards it.</p>
